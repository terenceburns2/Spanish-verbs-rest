REST API created using Spring Boot.

This project was created as a means to learn Spring's ecosystem. It is a simple RESTful API allowing you to view Spanish verb conjugations and subsequently "save" them.

Additionally, this project allowed me to develop a better understanding of Docker/Docker Compose.
